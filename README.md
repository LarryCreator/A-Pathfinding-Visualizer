# A*-Pathfinding-Visualizer
This is a implementation of the A* algorithm, a pathfinding algorithm that will always find the shortest path between two points. This app was made with html, css, js and React. You can move nodes around the canvas to change their positions, and if you click on the canvas, you can draw more obstacles. Follows the description of each button's function below:

Generate Maze: Generate random obstacles around the canvas.

Run Algorithm: Runs the algorithm to find the shortest path between the nodes.

Clear Path: Clears the path that was being drawn on the screen.

Clear Board: Clears the path and all obstacles from the screen. It makes it easier for you to draw your own obstacles.
